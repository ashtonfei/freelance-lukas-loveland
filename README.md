# Google Doc Automation

### Description

Would like to create a template for easy filling out of a google doc. Inputs would be from perhaps a google sheet or could be the doc itself, but once script is run would automatically fill out the google doc and store a pdf for me with signature already applied to send via email (or automatically send the email too). attached is the google doc which i would like to fill out automatically from google sheets. Not all of the fields will be used when getting filled out. Job consists of making the google sheet, and the script to fill out the google doc automatically and store a pdf of the signed document in a prenamed folder in google drive.

### Rules

1. As for the "fields", every blank underline in the document needs to have a fill in value
2. I do need "Arkansas" changed to "wisconsin"
3. Also any "[]" will just need an ability for me to put an "x" in the spreadsheet
4. Anything after the "subject to" addendum doesnt need to be done
